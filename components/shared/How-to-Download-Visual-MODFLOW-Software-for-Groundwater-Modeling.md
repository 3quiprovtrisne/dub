## Step 1: Choose the right version of Visual MODFLOW for your needs

Visual MODFLOW offers two types of licensing options: Stand-alone and Network (Team). A stand-alone license allows you to install and run the software on one computer only. You can choose between a softkey license, which is tied to the MAC address of your computer, or a hardkey license, which uses a USB dongle that you can move between different computers. A network license allows you to install and run the software on multiple computers on a network, as long as there are available seats on the license server. You can choose the number of seats you need for concurrent users.
